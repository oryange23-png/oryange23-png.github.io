            As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in <br>
            my arms and set out walking once more. <p class=underline>I felt deeply <br>
            moved and stirred. It seemed to me that I was <br>
            carrying a very fragile treasure.</p> <p class=highlight>It seemed to me, even, <br>
            that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</p> In the <br>
            moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed <br>
            eyes, his locks of hair that trmebled in the wind, and I <br>
            said to myself: <p class=quote>"What I see here is nothing but a <br>
            shell. What is most important is invisible..." </p><br>
            As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a <br>
            half-smile, I said to myself, again: <p class=quote>"What moves me <br>
            so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping <br>
            here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose <br>
            that shines through his whole being like the flame <br>
            of a lamp, even when he is asleep . . ."</p> And I felt <br>
            him to be more fragile still. <p class=underline>I felt the need of <br>
            protecting him, as if he by himself were a flame that <br>
            might be extinguished by a little puff of wind . . .</p> <br>
