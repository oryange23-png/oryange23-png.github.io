            As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in <br>
            my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply <br>
            movedm and stirred. It seemed to me that I was <br>
            carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, <br>
            that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the <br>
            moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed <br>
            eyes, his locks of hair that trmebled in the wind, and I <br>
            said to myself: "What I see here is nothing but a <br>
            shell. What is most important is invisible..." <br>
            As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a <br>
            half-smile, I said to myself, again: "What moves me <br>
            so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping <br>
            here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose <br>
            that shines through his whole being like the flame <br>
            of a lamp, even when he is asleep . . ." And I felt <br>
            him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of <br>
            protecting him, as if he by himself were a flame that <br>
            might be extinguished by a little puff of wind . . . <br>
