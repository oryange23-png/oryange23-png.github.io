            <p>As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in 
            my arms and set out walking once more.</p> <p class=underline>I felt deeply 
            moved and stirred. It seemed to me that I was 
            carrying a very fragile treasure.</p> <p class=highlight>It seemed to me, even, 
            that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</p> <p>In the 
            moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed 
            eyes, his locks of hair that trmebled in the wind, and I 
            said to myself:</p> <p class=quote>"What I see here is nothing but a 
            shell. What is most important is invisible..." </p> <p>
            As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a 
            half-smile, I said to myself, again:</p> <p class=quote>"What moves me 
            so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping 
            here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose 
            that shines through his whole being like the flame 
            of a lamp, even when he is asleep . . ."</p> <p>And I felt 
            him to be more fragile still.</p> <p class=underline>I felt the need of 
            protecting him, as if he by himself were a flame that 
            might be extinguished by a little puff of wind . . .</p>
